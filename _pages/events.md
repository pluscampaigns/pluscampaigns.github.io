	<b>+ Campaigns</b> organise events for clients, either independently or as part of an overall campaign. We cover client needs like the logistical development necessary for media attention, broadcasting, audio-visual services, guest invitations and content writing. We work on creating a coherent strategy for clients to combine media events with the general planning of a campaign, publication or audio-visual release. Due to our close media relationships we ensure political turnout and media attention to guarantee client satisfaction. Live audio-visual, anchoring and social media services are available at all events managed by <b>+ Campaigns</b>.
