	<b>+ Campaigns</b> puts great emphasis on the importance of pre-planned and well structured methodological advertisement strategy and visual or editorial trend setting. Only through innovation and dedicated market analysis does it become possible to fully reach all target groups necessary for a successful campaign. We therefore liaise consistently with clients and other partners before embarking upon any campaign. Only once we have a full and calibrated understanding of our clientâ€™s needs do we embark upon a quantitative and qualitative market and target analysis, which is followed by visual and auditory research. The end result is therefore a calculated product of business strategy and sociology, combined with advertisement psychology, statistics and visual aesthetics.
