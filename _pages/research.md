<p>
	+ We’re in touch with your audience 
</p>
<p>
	It’s important to remember the importance of research. Whether in advertisement or political communication, our academic and quantitative or qualitative understanding of audiences, markets and society play an important role in determining the difference between a good and poor media strategy. 
</p>
<p>
	<b>+ Campaigns</b> rely heavily on two practices: data analysis and qualitative Internet studies. Both help us understand how to best communicate our ideas and goals to a large and often diverse audience. We therefore constantly follow online trends and analysis on social media, while studying media trends, design, fashion, music spikes, cinematography and other important contributors to mass audience viral videos. 
</p>
<p>
	And in this way we combine the better of two worlds: academic study and popular culture. Together with advertisement strategy and a deep socio-cultural understanding <b>+ Campaigns</b> aims higher than its predecessors. 
</p>
<p>
	We’re not only set on being innovative and creative. We blend politics and culture at the most advanced level, targeting our mass audiences with a calculated methodology of beauty, numbers and societal understanding.
