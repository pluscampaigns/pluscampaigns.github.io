	<b>+ Campaigns</b> relies on a variety of communication tools, including social media platforms like Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest and Google Plus. We also heavily rely on Google Analytics and a variety of other analysis software designed to measure community interaction, feedback and viewer assessments. Apart from setting up accounts for clients and managing their daily social media content, we also strategise client’s social media methodology, target audience, and interaction techniques.

	We also use RRS feeds, blogs, online advertisement, content management systems, newsletters and new websites.

	We equally provide in-house training in social media development to develop our client’s know-how, as we believe in the importance of creating self-sufficient business.
